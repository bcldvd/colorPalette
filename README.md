colorPalette
=====================

A project designed to have a simple palette of colors for your (and my) future projects. Choose five colors per project, and use lighten() and darken() Less method's if necessary.

## Using this project

If you want to install this project on your machine, just run bower to install dependencies

```bash
$ bower install
```

Otherwise, add [colors.less](https://github.com/bcldvd/colorPalette/blob/master/app/styles/less/colors.less) to your existing project.

More info on Less can be found on the Less [Getting Started](http://lesscss.org/) page.
